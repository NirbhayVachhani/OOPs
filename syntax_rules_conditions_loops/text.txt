1. Average of integers

Write a program that gets a positive integer (i.e. a value > 1) from the user and computes the average of all integers from 1 up and including that number.  Print the result formatted like the sample run below.   No need to test for invalid integers.



2. A while loop with errors

Assume a program has been written for the task of adding all integers I = 1, 2, ...10: 

Some_number = 0
i = 1
While i < 11
	Some_number += 1
Print some_number

a. Identify the errors in the above program by only reading the code.

b. Write a new version of the program with the errors corrected. Run this program and confirm that it gives the correct output.
Sample run:
55


3. Simple calculator with loop
